# FpsToggleMod (Alpha)

A mod for *Get To Work* that allows players to easily swap FPS during gameplay, eliminating the need to tab out with RivaTunner. This is especially useful for things like topgrabs while in speedrunning. This mod only changes fps nothing else about the game.

**Note**: This mod is in the alpha phase and still requires testing. It is not yet approved for speedrun.com submissions(but soon maybe I havent asked yet).

## Features

- **Easily switch FPS** without tabbing out of the game.
- **Custom FPS limits**: Set your preferred FPS values for smoother gameplay.
- **Default Hotkeys**:
  - **H**: Open/close the menu.
  - **K**, **L**, **O**: Keys for switching FPS (keyboard).
  - **Dpad buttons**: Default for controllers (controller support still needs testing but should work I hope).
- **Customizable hotkeys**: You can change the hotkeys if the defaults don't work or if you prefer other keys.
- **Debug stats**: A debug menu is included in the current version top right. If you experience any bugs, please provide a video with the debug stats open if possible.
